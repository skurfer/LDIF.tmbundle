## LDIF TextMate Bundle ##

This bundle adds LDIF support to TextMate.

For more complete support, you may want to add something like this to the `CFBundleDocumentTypes` section in `TextMate.app/Contents/Info.plist`:

    {   CFBundleTypeName = "LDAP Data Interchange Format";
        CFBundleTypeExtensions = (ldif); 
        CFBundleTypeIconFile = TMDocument; 
    }, 

You should make a backup copy of TextMate before you mess around inside it.
